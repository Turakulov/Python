# There are few educational and work projects

### Education
- Offline shop database.

  Данное приложение было написано на первом курсе обучения в рамках изучения дисциплины Python.
  Ознакомиться с руководством пользователя можно тут [Link](https://github.com/Turakulov/Python/tree/master/Work)
  
- Image detecting using сonvolutional neural networks.

  The idea behind this figure is to show, that such neural network configuration 
  is identical with a 2D convolution operation and weights
  are just filters (also called kernels, convolution matrices, or masks)

- Image clustering. 

  Clustering is a technique that helps in grouping similar items together based on particular attributes. 
  We are going to apply K-means clustering to the image with 6-7 colors [Link](https://github.com/Turakulov/Python/blob/master/Education/Clustering/clustering.ipynb)

### Work  
- Richtracks prediction model
