### Task descriprion

Imagine that you are the marketing consultants of some financial organization like a bank. The
company wants to drive sales and customer activity using a data-driven approach.
You are provided with 3 parts of the dataset (are in archived file “HW1_data”):
- Customer features (id, age, city, registration date, communication channels available)
- Transactional features (date of purchase, product category (MCC), transaction amount, number of purchases)
- The description of MCC codes (is needed to map the product categories names and mcc_id in transactional table).

#### Goals
You should segment the sample of customer base in order to find the key consumer segments and create the marketing strategy to achieve the company’s goal.  
1. Analyze the data. What features are there in the dataset? Which of them may be useful for the segmentation? Clean the dataset if needed (1 points).
2. Use the cohorts to analyze the customers activity in dynamics. What can be said about the customers behavior? (1.5 points)
3. Perform the cluster analysis. Choose the optimal number of clusters (should be shown) and features (try various combinations to find the most appropriate one). Generate additional features if they are needed. (1.5 points)
4. Describe the customers in each cluster. Which significant characteristics can be underlined? (1 point)
5. Choose the KPI (“metrics of success”) for each segment (what can be grown/ decreased/increased), explain your choice. (1 point)
6. Think of possible marketing initiatives that could potentially drive the chosen metrics for each segment. Generate 3-5 hypothesis and test them using statistical criteria (remember that we can use parametric criteria like t-test only if the data distribution is known). (2 points)
7. Write the marketing strategy based on the results of hypothesis testing. Don’t forget about the communication channels! Suggest the formats and place of communication message delivery (emails, banners in mobile app, etc.). (2 points)
